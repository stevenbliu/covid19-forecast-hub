team_model_designation: primary
ensemble_of_hub_models: false
methods: We used the compartmental model analyze case data available for each State.
  The model consists of ordinary differential equations describing the dynamics of
  40 populations (state variables).

methods_long: We used a compartmental model consists of ordinary differential equations
  (ODEs) describing the dynamics of 40 populations (state variables). The model quantified
  the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (social distancing for example) on
  COVID-19 transmission dynamics, and captures vaccination of susceptible and recovered
  persons and infected non-quarantined persons without symptoms at a time-varying
  per capita rate. This vaccination rate is updated daily for consistency with MSA-specific
  daily reports of completed vaccinations. The model also captures immune responses
  to vaccination yielding varying degrees of protection and the consequences of breakthrough
  infection of vaccinated persons. Vaccine protection against transmissible infection
  was taken to be variant-dependent. The parameterized models provide estimates of
  the relative transmissibility of Alpha and Delta, as well as their takeover times
  in each State (i.e., the times at which the variants became dominant). Using Bayesian
  inference, we calibrate region-specific models daily for consistency with new reports
  of confirmed cases from the 50 States in US and quantify uncertainty in parameter
  estimates and predictions of future case reports. This online learning approach
  allows for early identification of new trends despite considerable variability in
  case reporting. Details of the model can be found in 'citation'.
