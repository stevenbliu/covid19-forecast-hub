ensemble_of_hub_models: false
methods: Nation-level model of confirmed cases and deaths based on ridge regression.  No
  assumptions made about social distancing.
team_funding: University of Michigan Physics Department; University of Michigan Office of
  Research
methods_long: "This model uses ridge regression (penalized Ordinary Least Squares\
  \ regression) to make predictions about future confirmed case and mortality trends.\
  \  The model makes forecasts based solely on previous data, so no external  assumptions\
  \ are necessary.    \nThe ridge regressors built for this model use Finite Impulse\
  \ Response (FIR)  filtration to predict each day's confirmed cases and deaths as\
  \ a function of  the counts on previous days. Specifically, each day's counts are\
  \ predicted as  a linear combination of the counts on a user-specified number of\
  \ previous days.  The goal of the regressors is the determination of an optimal\
  \ coefficient vector  for these predictive linear combinations. The model currently\
  \ makes predictions  based on the previous 14 days.\nOnce the regressors are created,\
  \ bootstrapping is used to create a spectrum of predictions, from which quantiles are\
  \ determined."
