team_model_designation: primary
ensemble_of_hub_models: false
methods: This model utilizes a County-level spatial panel data model for 2062 counties of contiguous United States.
team_funding: None
data_inputs: GoogleCloudPlatform/covid-19-open-data and apple mobility data

methods_long: "On the website we provide weekly prediction for\
  \ Infections for 2062 US counties.\ 
  \ The model employs the weekly change in mobility, weather data,\
  \ alongside the current non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs),\
  \ and mitigating policies that are in practice in each jurisdiction.\
  \ The model incorporates a 1 week lag between mobility-NPI change\
  \ and CVOID-19 cases and assumes that existing mobility pattern and NPI\
  \ measures in each jurisdiction will continue through the projected 4-week time period."
